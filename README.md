# Butterfly60_split
A split keyboard using rp2040, also supporting deej and potentiometers.


I will be connecting only the left side split to the usb cable.
I have modified the core files of the qmk and chibiOS for the deej functionality.

I havent got the documentation ready, once i rectify this cold boot issue, i will be giving out each and every information about what i did.
